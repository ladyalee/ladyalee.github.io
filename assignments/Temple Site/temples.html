            <article>Dallas is the 30th operating temple and is the sister building to the
                Boise Idaho Temple and the Chicago Illinois Temple. Ordinance work in the
                Dallas Texas Temple has been performed for historical figures of special
                significance to the citizens of Texas. For example, work was completed in
                1986 for those involved in the tragedy at the Alamo on March 6, 1836.
                In addition, work for 1,500 "Trail of Tears" Choctaw Indians was performed in the temple.

            <article>
                Nashville is the 84th operating temple. When the First Presidency announced plans for the Nashville 
                Tennessee Temple, there were only four operating temples east of the Mississippi River. A 
                week-long open house was held for the Nashville Tennessee Temple, which was toured by over 
                24,300 visitors, an average of more than 3,000 a day. Temple matron Diane McClurg noted, 
                "I heard people say as they went out that they felt different when they were inside. 
                That's a lot of what it's all aboutâ€”the feeling of the Spirit."

                    Manti is the 3rd operating temple with plans of renovation in the
                    near future. It sits atop "Temple Hill" in Central Utah. The Manti
                    Utah Temple features beautiful hand-painted murals on the walls of
                    its progressive-style ordinance rooms: Creation Room, Garden Room,
                    World Room, Terrestrial Room (no murals), and Celestial Room (no murals).
                    Lightning struck the east tower of the Manti Utah Temple in 1928, which
                    started a fire that burned for three hours before it could be extinguished.

                <h3>History:</h3>
                <article>Billings is the 66th operating temple built in the biggest city in Montana.
                    On the exterior, the temple is unique in many ways. The spire, topped by
                    a statue of Angel Moroni, rises from a tiered tower faced with louvered vents
                    that appear to be shuttered windows. The west end of the single story building
                    is accentuated by a stained-glass bay window. The temple grounds are landscaped
                    with lawns, flower gardens and more than 250 trees and 4,500 shrubs. Retaining walls
                    and fence foundations are built of manufactured stones painted to match the prominent,
                    300-foot-high Rimrock cliffs that border the rear side of the temple property.</article>
